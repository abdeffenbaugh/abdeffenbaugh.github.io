			<p>My class assignments are not hard, but also not easy. Each chapter and it's assignments have a due date, and if we do not finish any assignments after due date, it a zero. Each assignment teaches us to do new things, which would help us form a base in programming. There are also discussion assignments, where we answer some questions or show our work to the whole class. The major assignments are usually based on coding.
			</p>
			<p> As this class is pace based class, everything is on webassign. Webassign is a place where we could view the instructions, assignments, and we can learn things.
